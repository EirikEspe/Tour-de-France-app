# Tour de France app
This is a web app with statistics from Tour de France 1903-2019, created with Shiny.

Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, with occasional
passes to nearby countries. Held over three weeks, usually in July, the Tour consists of 21 day-long stages
over the course of 23 days. The route for each edition changes each year, but the format of the race stays the same,
with the appearance of time trials, the passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps, before the
riders finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The modern editions of the Tour de France have covered around 3500 kilometres, 
and the route alternates between clockwise and counter-clockwise circuits of France.
